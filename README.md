# Partial Derivative Calculator

## Project Overview
This project, developed as an Honors Contract Project for Calculus III, is a web-based Partial Derivative Calculator. It leverages Python's symbolic mathematics capabilities to provide an intuitive and accessible tool for calculating partial derivatives of multivariable functions.

## Key Features
- **Web-based Interface**: Built using Gradio, a Python library for creating web-based machine learning applications, ensuring easy accessibility without any installation requirements.
- **Multi-variable Support**: Capable of handling functions with multiple variables.
- **Symbolic Computation**: Utilizes SymPy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, to perform accurate symbolic differentiation.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Provides a user-friendly interface for input and display of results.

## Technical Details
- **Language**: Python
- **Key Libraries**: 
  - SymPy for symbolic mathematics
  - Gradio for the web interface
- **Core Components**:
  1. Tokenizer: Breaks down input expressions into individual components
  2. Parser: Analyzes the tokenized input and creates a structured representation
  3. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): Organizes the expression components into a tree structure for efficient processing

## Motivation
- Enhance understanding and visualization of partial derivatives
- Provide a practical tool for Calculus III students and beyond
- Demonstrate the application of project-based learning in advanced mathematics

## Project Significance
Partial derivatives are crucial in multivariable calculus, forming the foundation for concepts like gradients and directional derivatives. This calculator serves as both an educational tool and a practical utility for students and professionals working with multivariable functions.

## Future Directions
- Extend functionality to include higher-order derivatives
- Implement additional calculus operations (e.g., multiple integrals)
- Enhance visualization capabilities for 3D representations of functions and their derivatives
